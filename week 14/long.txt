 It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me. No guns, no killing.

 I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.

 Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area. Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended.

 It's ends here. My anger outweights my guilt. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.
